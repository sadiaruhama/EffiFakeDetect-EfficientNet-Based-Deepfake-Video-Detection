🎭 Unmasking Deepfakes
Leveraging Deep Learning for Video Authenticity Detection

🚀 A deep learning–based framework for detecting deepfake videos using MTCNN + EfficientNet architecture.

📌 Project Overview

With the rapid growth of AI-generated media, Deepfake technology has become a serious threat to digital authenticity. This project proposes a robust deep learning pipeline that detects whether a video is REAL or FAKE by:

🎥 Converting videos into frames

🧑 Detecting and extracting faces using MTCNN

🧠 Classifying faces using EfficientNet

📊 Evaluating performance using Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

The goal is to build a scalable and efficient detection system capable of identifying subtle manipulations in facial regions.

🧠 Models Used
1️⃣ MTCNN (Face Detection)

Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Network used to:

Detect faces in each frame

Extract bounding boxes

Identify facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth)

This ensures the model focuses only on important facial regions instead of background noise.

2️⃣ EfficientNet-B0 (Classification)

EfficientNet uses compound scaling (depth, width, resolution) to achieve high accuracy with fewer parameters.

✔ Computationally efficient
✔ Strong feature extraction
✔ Optimized for image classification
